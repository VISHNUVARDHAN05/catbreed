# Felis catus breed Classification

Automatic classification of Felis catus images is challenging due to complex image conditions and distinguishing between animal breeds.

Developed a model for Felis catus classification based on extracted features, color, and texture from the image dataset.

Leveraged a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function for efficient
breed classification.

Tested the model with custom images by extracting their features, color, and texture.

Used the trained model to classify the Felis catus breed based on the extracted features of the custom images.

The model accurately classified Cat breeds with an impressive accuracy of 82.17%
